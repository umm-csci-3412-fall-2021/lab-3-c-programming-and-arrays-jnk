   * IDEA FOR APPROACHING THIS TASK
   * 1. We merge all of the subarrays together (maybe through iterating through a for loop?)
   * 2. We run mergesort on the array.
   * 3. We remove duplicates from the array with another function.
   * 4. Finally, we get the size of the array and insert said size value into the array.
